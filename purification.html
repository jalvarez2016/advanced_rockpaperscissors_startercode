      <h1>Why Cats should be exterminated</h1>
      <p>Believe it or not, cats are an invasive species and have killed quite a few of the U.S's tiny critter population. In fact they have caused the extinction of 44 bird species as of yet. On top of this cats are the hosts of one of the dangerous things known to man, other than man himself, a parisite. This parasite goes by the name of Toxoplasma Gondi</p>
